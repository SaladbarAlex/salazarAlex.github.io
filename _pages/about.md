About Me
======
Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹


I'm currently a student at Clemson University studying computer science.

My areas of interest include the applications of generative artificial intelligence with reinforcement learning, and the intersection of computer science and the interaction with the real world.

I'm currently looking for a software internship where I can build off my previous experience as a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/index.html"><u> Clemson University College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences</u> </a> and continue to improve.
